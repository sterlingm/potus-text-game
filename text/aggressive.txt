Mr. President! You can't press that button!
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
You're going to kill MILLIONS of people you sick bastard!
That's absurd! You can't just rely on only your opinion.
Well that's stupid.
Good god sir! Have some dignity!
You are a disgrace. There's not a single other person in this building that would even consider what you're doing!
If you do this, you'll lose the respect of everyone close to you, and everyone around the world.
Fine, press the fucking button and you and Putin can live alone on an island and buttfuck each other all day long. Sound good? Because if you do this, you'll never be free again.
Stop being an idiot.
You're shaming America far more than any tweet.
You're delusional if you think that there won't be a severe backlash to this.
...Seriously?!
Mr. President, stop letting your own shitty belief system affect the rest of the world!
Those people are innocent Mr. President! We won't let you do this!

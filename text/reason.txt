Take a deep breath Mr. President, and really think about this. There has to be another way. We have more resources than any other nation to ever exist. Our hands reach in nearly every corner of the world. Our businesses support the global economy. Our military is the best on Earth. We can get back at them a different way. You are the President of the United States of America! Think! What else can we do?

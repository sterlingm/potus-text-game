Mr. President! Please think about what you're doing.
This is not a good idea Mr. President. Millions of people will die. The world will never be the same.
Mr. President...we need to have a discussion about this. We both know a lot, but together we can think of something even better.
Does Ivanka know about this?
Wait! Hear me out! Come on, let's actually talk about it.
Come on Mr. President, did Putin set you up to this? Forget about him! He's a terrible influence! Think about US! We love you! You don't need that guy!
Mr. President, you have the love and respect of many people, myself included.
Look, this is a bad idea. There's no way around it. It's a kneejerk reaction and you know it.
What did the Vice President have to say about this?
Let me tell you what I think.
Just take a few moments and try to imagine life after pressing the button. Do you see yourself as still being President? Do you see the people loving you after you murdering millions of innocent lives?
Okay, well, what's your move AFTER pressing the button? How will you deal with the backlash?
Why would you care about that?
*Deep breath*...Mr. President...you are smarter than this.
Nobody deal with more stress than you. But you cannot let your stress affect your decision making.
